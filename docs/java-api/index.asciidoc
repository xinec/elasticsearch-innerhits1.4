== Preface
This section describes the Java API that elasticsearch provides. All
elasticsearch operations are executed using a
<<client,Client>> object. All
operations are completely asynchronous in nature (either accepts a
listener, or returns a future).

Additionally, operations on a client may be accumulated and executed in
<<bulk,Bulk>>.

Note, all the APIs are exposed through the
Java API (actually, the Java API is used internally to execute them).


== Maven Repository

Elasticsearch is hosted on
http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22elasticsearch%22[Maven
Central].

For example, you can define the latest version in your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>
    <artifactId>elasticsearch</artifactId>
    <version>${es.version}</version>
</dependency>
